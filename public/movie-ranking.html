  <h1>The Best Movies according to Jay </h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>End of Evangelion</h3>
  <p>This the greatest anime film. I loved the action sequences and the intricate symbolisms and imagery.</p>
  <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
  <p>Powerhouse performances, especially by the late Heath Ledger; containing realistic action sequences and an amazing
    score.</p>
  <h3>Social Network</h3>
  <p>Directed by one of my favorite directors David Fincher; it contains one of the best written screenplays for a
    movie.</p>
